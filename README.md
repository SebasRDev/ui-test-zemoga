# Formula Monks UI TEST

This project is a solution to the [ui-test](https://github.com/zemoga/ui-test) provided by Formula Monks. It is deployed on Netlify for test purposes at [https://ui-test-sebastian.netlify.app](https://ui-test-sebastian.netlify.app).

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- Vitest (for unit tests)
- Local Storage (for data persistence)
- pnpm (as the package manager)

## How to Run

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/SebasRDev/ui-test-zemoga.git
```

Install dependencies:

```zsh
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```zsh
pnpm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to localhost to view the app.

## Notes

- Make sure you have `pnpm` installed globally.
- The data is persisted using local storage, so changes will be saved across sessions.
- Unit tests can be run using `pnpm run test`.
